/*
 *  Answer: O(N + M) time, O(1) space
 * ===============================================================================
 *  Explanation:
 *  
 * Complexities like O(1) and O(n) are simple to understand. 
 * O(1) means, it requires constant time to perform operations like to reach an element in constant time as in case of dictionary
 * O(n) means, it depends on the value of n to perform operations such as searching an element in an array of n elements.
 * 
 * 
 * ** O(Log n) **
 * 
 * O(Log n), it is not that simple. Let us discuss this with the help of Binary Search Algorithm whose complexity is O(log n).
 * 
 * ** Binary Search: ** 
 * =====================
 * Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. 
 * If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. 
 * Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.
 * 
 * **Example:**
 * 
 * 
 * index	 			   =>		 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |
 * 									  -----------------------------------------------	
 *  Search 23			   =>        | 2 | 5 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 23 | 38 | 56 | 72 | 91 | 
 *  
 *  23 > 16, take 2nd half =>        | 2 | 5 | 8 | 12 |(16)| 23 | 38 | 56 | 72 | 91 | 
 *  
 *  23 < 56, take 1st half =>        | * | * | * | ** | ** | 23 | 38 |(56)| 72 | 91 | 
 *   
 *  Search 23			   =>        | * | * | * | ** | ** |(23)| 38 | ** | ** | ** |  
 *  
 *  
 *  ** Solution Step by Step **
 *  ==========================================
 *  
 * Sorted Array of 10 elements: 2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91
 * Let us say we want to search for 23. 
 * 
 * Finding the given element:  Now to find 23, there will be many iterations with each having steps as mentioned:
 *  
 * ** Iteration 1: Array: 2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91  
 * => Select the middle element. (here 16) 
 * => Since 23 is greater than 16, so we divide the array into two halves and consider the sub-array after element 16. 
 * => Now this subarray with the elements after 16 will be taken into next iteration. 
 * 
 *
 * ** Iteration 2: Array: 23, 38, 56, 72, 91  
 * => Select the middle element. (now 56) 
 * => Since 23 is smaller than 56, so we divide the array into two halves and consider the sub-array before element 56. 
 * => Now this subarray with the elements before 56s will be taken into next iteration. 
 * 
 * 
 * ** Iteration 3: Array: 23, 38  
 * => Select the middle element. (now 23) 
 * => Since 23 is the middle element. So the iterations will now stop.  
 * 
 * 
 * ** Calculating Time complexity: **
 * ==================================
 * 
 * => Let say the iteration in Binary Search terminates after k iterations. In the above example, it terminates after 3 iterations, so here k = 3 
 * => At each iteration, the array is divided by half. So letâ€™s say the length of array at any iteration is n 
 * 
 * ** At Iteration 1,** : Length of array = n  
 * ** At Iteration 2,** : Length of array = n/2 
 * ** At Iteration 3,** : Length of array = (n/2)/2 = (n/2)^2  
 * ** Therefore, after Iteration k,**: Length of array = (n/2)^k 
 * 
 * Also, we know that after, After k divisions, the length of array becomes 1. Therefore, Length of array = (n/2)^k = 1
 * => n = 2^k 
 * 
 * **Applying log function on both sides:**
 * => log2 (n) = log2 (2^k) 
 * => log2 (n) = k log2 (2) 
 * 
 * As (loga (a) = 1) Therefore => k = log2 (n)
 *  
 * Hence, the time complexity of Binary Search is:	log2 (n)
